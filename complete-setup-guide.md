## 🎯 **Phase 3: Set Up Basic Version (Start Here)**

The basic version is stable and guaranteed to work. Start here first!

ls -la
# You should see: package.json, src/, public/, etc.
```

### **Step 3.2: Install Dependencies**

npm install

# OR if you have bun (faster)
bun install

# Expected output: dependency installation without errors
```

### **Step 3.3: Start Development Server**

# Start the app
npm run dev

# OR with bun
bun run dev
```

### **Step 3.4: Success Indicators**

## 🔥 **Phase 5: Upgrade to Full-Featured Version**

Once the basic version works, let's try the full-featured version!

### **Step 5.1: Open New Terminal**
Keep the basic app running, open a new terminal:

cd path/to/todo/material-todo-app

# Check the structure
ls -la
# You should see more files and directories than the basic version
```

### **Step 5.2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Clean install (recommended for full version)
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json bun.lock

# Install dependencies
npm install
# OR
bun install
```

### **Step 5.3: Start Full-Featured App**
```bash
# Start on a different port (basic app should still be running)
npm run dev -- --port 3000
# OR
bun run dev --port 3000
```

### **Step 5.4: Open Full-Featured Version**
- Go to: http://localhost:3000
- You should see the enhanced interface with additional features

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: Port 5173 Already in Use**
```bash
# Kill existing processes
npx kill-port 5173
# OR
pkill -f vite

# Try again
npm run dev
```

### **Issue: Dependencies Won't Install**
```bash
# Clear everything
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json bun.lock
npm cache clean --force

# Try with legacy peer deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start app
npm run dev
```

### **Issue: Build Errors in Full Version**
```bash
# Go back to basic version (always works)
cd ../todo-app-fixed
npm run dev

# Once basic works, try full version again with clean install
cd ../material-todo-app
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

### **Issue: App Loads But Looks Broken**
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Try in incognito/private mode

### **Issue: Can't Find Repository Locally**
```bash
# Find where you cloned it
find ~ -name "todo" -type d 2>/dev/null

# Or clone again in a specific location
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/Edyrichards/todo.git
```
