# 🔍 PR #1 vs PR #3 Comparison Guide

Let's systematically compare your PR #1 (animations & mobile gestures) with my PR #3 (comprehensive enhancement) to see what's different.

## 📋 **How to Compare PRs on GitHub**

### **Step 1: Check PR #1 Details**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Edyrichards/todo/pull/1
2. Click on **"Files changed"** tab
3. Note down:
   - Which files were modified
   - What dependencies were added to `package.json`
   - What components were created/modified
   - What animation/gesture features were implemented

### **Step 2: Check PR #3 Details**  
1. Go to: https://github.com/Edyrichards/todo/pull/3
2. Click on **"Files changed"** tab
