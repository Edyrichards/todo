- `useStagger`: Staggered animations for lists

#### **Spring Configurations**
- Pre-configured spring settings for different interaction types
- Optimized for performance and natural feel

- **Interactive Elements**: Animated form controls and buttons
- **Error Handling**: Visual feedback for form validation
- **Success States**: Success animation after task creation/update

### 10. Enhanced Sidebar
Improvements:
- **Navigation Buttons**: All buttons use AnimatedButton with tap animations
- **Menu Items**: Smooth hover effects with micro-movements
- **PWA Status**: Integrated PWA status component at bottom
- **Category Lists**: Staggered animations for category items
- **Filter Actions**: Animated filter and clear actions

### 11. Page Transitions
Improvements:
- **View Switching**: Different animation variants for each view type
  - Tasks: FadeInUp for familiar list entrance
  - Calendar: ScaleIn for calendar grid appearance
  - Kanban: SlideInLeft for board-like entrance
- **Stagger Children**: Smooth staggered animations for child elements
- **Custom Easing**: Carefully tuned easing curves for natural motion

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Will-change Properties**: Applied strategically for smooth animations
- **GPU Acceleration**: Transform-based animations for optimal performance
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's motion preferences
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Minimal React re-renders during animations

### Accessibility
- **Motion Preferences**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling during animations
- **Screen Reader**: Animations don't interfere with assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhanced keyboard interactions with visual feedback

### Animation Timing
- **Entrance**: 300-400ms for comfortable perception
- **Micro-interactions**: 150-200ms for responsive feel
- **Page Transitions**: 400ms for smooth view changes
- **Loading States**: Continuous animations with appropriate timing

## User Experience Impact

### Perceived Performance
- **Loading Feedback**: Users understand when operations are in progress
- **Instant Feedback**: Immediate visual response to user actions
