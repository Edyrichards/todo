# Mobile Gestures & Touch Interactions Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive mobile-friendly swipe gestures and touch interactions implementation for the Material Todo application, designed to provide a native mobile app experience in the browser.

## Core Gesture Infrastructure

### 1. Gesture Utilities Library (`src/lib/gestureUtils.ts`)
Created a comprehensive gesture library with:

#### **Gesture Configuration**
- Swipe thresholds and velocity settings

- Long press duration
- Touch feedback and haptic settings

#### **Haptic Feedback System**
- `triggerHaptic()`: Native vibration API integration
- Light, medium, heavy feedback patterns
- Conditional support based on device capabilities

#### **Core Gesture Hooks**
- `useSwipeGesture()`: Multi-directional swipe detection with velocity
- `usePullToRefresh()`: Pull-down-to-refresh with visual feedback
- `useLongPress()`: Long press detection with timeout handling
- `useTouchFeedback()`: Universal touch feedback for buttons
- `useViewNavigation()`: Swipe-based view switching

#### **Utility Functions**
- Device detection (`isMobileDevice()`)
- Touch target sizing (`getTouchTargetSize()`)
- Spring configurations for natural animations
