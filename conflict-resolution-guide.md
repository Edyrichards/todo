# üîç How to Check for Pull Request Conflicts

Since I can't directly browse GitHub, here's how you can check for conflicts in your repository:

## üìã **Step 1: Check Your Repository Status**

### **Go to Your Repository:**
1. Visit: https://github.com/Edyrichards/todo
2. Look at the main page to see:
   - How many open pull requests you have
   - Any conflict indicators

### **Check Pull Requests Tab:**
1. Click on **"Pull requests"** tab
2. Look for any open PRs (should see PR #3 if it's still open)
3. Check for conflict warnings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Step 2: Identify Conflicts**

### **Visual Indicators on GitHub:**
- **Red warning**: "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved"
- **Gray indicator**: "This branch cannot be automatically merged"
- **Green checkmark**: "Able to merge" (no conflicts)

### **Common Conflict Sources:**
- Multiple people editing the same files
- Changes to `package.json` dependencies
- Modifications to the same lines of code
- File deletions/moves

## üõ†Ô∏è **Step 3: Resolve Conflicts (If Any Exist)**

### **Option A: Resolve on GitHub (Simple Conflicts)**
1. Click on the conflicted PR
2. Click **"Resolve conflicts"** button
3. Edit the files directly in GitHub
4. Choose which changes to keep
5. Click **"Mark as resolved"**
6. Commit the resolution

### **Option B: Resolve Locally (Complex Conflicts)**
```bash
# Clone/update your repository
git clone https://github.com/Edyrichards/todo.git
cd todo

# Fetch the PR branch
git fetch origin feature/complete-todo-enhancement

# Switch to main and update
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Try to merge the PR branch
git merge origin/feature/complete-todo-enhancement

# If conflicts occur, Git will show you which files have conflicts
# Edit the conflicted files and resolve them
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

## üéØ **Step 4: What to Look For**

### **Check These Files for Potential Conflicts:**
- `package.json` (dependency conflicts)
- `README.md` (documentation conflicts)
- `.gitignore` (ignore pattern conflicts)
- Any files you may have modified since the original repository

### **Most Likely Scenario:**
Since I created the PR from your original repository, conflicts are unlikely UNLESS:
- You've made changes to the same files since then
- You have other open PRs that modify similar files
- Someone else has pushed changes to your main branch

## üöÄ **Step 5: Quick Resolution Strategy**

### **If No Conflicts:**
‚úÖ Simply merge the PR as normal!

### **If Minor Conflicts (package.json, etc.):**
1. Accept both changes where possible
2. Keep the newer/enhanced versions
3. Merge and test

### **If Major Conflicts:**
1. Back up any important changes you've made
2. Consider merging the PR first
3. Then apply your changes on top
4. Test thoroughly

## üìû **Need Help with Specific Conflicts?**

If you encounter specific conflicts, share the conflict details with me and I can help you resolve them. Common conflict patterns:

### **Package.json Conflicts:**
```json
<<<<<<< HEAD
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.0.0"
}
=======
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^19.0.0"
}
>>>>>>> feature/complete-todo-enhancement
```
**Resolution:** Choose the newer version (React 19)

### **File Content Conflicts:**
```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Your changes
=======
// My changes
>>>>>>> feature/complete-todo-enhancement
```
**Resolution:** Combine both changes or choose the better implementation

## üîÑ **Check Right Now:**

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/Edyrichards/todo/pulls
2. **Look for:** PR #3 status indicator
3. **If green:** ‚úÖ Ready to merge!
4. **If red:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflicts need resolution
