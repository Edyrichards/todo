## 🎯 **Step 3: Choose Your Version & Set Up**

You now have **3 versions** to choose from. I recommend starting with the basic version first:

### **Option A: Basic Version (Recommended First) 🌟**

This is the stable version that's guaranteed to work:

```bash
# Navigate to basic version
cd todo-app-fixed

# Install dependencies (choose one)
npm install
# OR (if you have bun - faster)
bun install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# OR
bun run dev
```

**✅ Success Indicators:**
- Terminal shows: `Local: http://localhost:5173`
- No error messages
- Opens browser automatically or manually go to http://localhost:5173

### **Option B: Full-Featured Version 🔥**

Once the basic version works, try the full-featured version:

```bash
# Go back to main directory
cd ..

# Navigate to full version
cd material-todo-app

# Clean install (recommended)
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json bun.lock

# Install dependencies
npm install
# OR
bun install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# OR  
bun run dev
```

**✅ What You Get:**
- Calendar views (Month/Week/Day)
- Kanban board with drag & drop
- Analytics dashboard
- PWA features
- Mobile gestures
- Advanced animations

### **Option C: Full-Stack Version 🚀**

For the complete experience with backend:

#### **Terminal 1 - Backend Setup:**
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start database services (requires Docker)
./dev-setup.sh start

# Wait for databases to start (30 seconds), then:
npm run migrate  # Set up database schema
npm run seed     # Add sample data

# Start backend server
npm run dev
```

#### **Terminal 2 - Frontend Setup:**
```bash
# In a new terminal, navigate to frontend
cd material-todo-app

# Install and start frontend
npm install && npm run dev
# OR
bun install && bun run dev
```

**✅ Full-Stack Success:**
- Backend: http://localhost:3001

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: "Command not found" errors**
```bash
# Make sure you have Node.js 18+
node --version

# Install if needed from: https://nodejs.org
```

### **Issue: Port 5173 already in use**

# Kill existing processes
npx kill-port 5173
# OR
pkill -f vite

# Try again
npm run dev
```

### **Issue: Dependencies won't install**
```bash
# Clear everything and try again
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json bun.lock

# Use npm with legacy peer deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

### **Issue: Build errors in full version**
```bash
# Go back to basic version first
cd ../todo-app-fixed
npm install && npm run dev

# Once that works, try full version again
```

### **Issue: Backend won't start**
