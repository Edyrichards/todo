### Recovery Mechanisms
1. **Immediate Retry**: User-initiated retry button
2. **Auto-Retry**: 5-second delayed automatic retry
3. **Data Reset**: Clear corrupted local storage
4. **Navigation Fallback**: Return to safe application state
5. **Full Reload**: Last resort complete refresh

### Error Types Handled
- **Component Failures**: Individual component crashes
- **Feature Failures**: Entire view/feature breakdown
- **Data Corruption**: Invalid or corrupted state
- **Network Issues**: API and WebSocket failures
- **Performance Issues**: Memory leaks and slow renders

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Real-Time Metrics Dashboard
Created comprehensive performance monitoring system:

```typescript
// Performance metrics tracked
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  renderTime: number;        // Component render duration
  componentCount: number;    // Active components
  memoryUsage: number;       // JS heap size
  taskCount: number;         // Managed tasks
  fps: number;              // Application frame rate
  isVirtual: boolean;       // Virtual scrolling status
}
```

### Monitoring Features
- **Real-Time Display**: Live performance metrics overlay
- **Performance Alerts**: Warnings for slow renders and high memory usage
- **Development Tools**: Detailed performance analysis in dev mode
- **Production Ready**: Configurable monitoring for production deployment

## 🎛️ Feature Toggle System
